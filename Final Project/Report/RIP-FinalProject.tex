In this paper, planning and machine learning concepts are applied to the design of an autonomous agent to play an "asteroids" type computer game.

\section{Introduction}
The "asteroids" genre of games poses several interesting planning problems. In this game, the player controls a spaceship in an environment that is filled with fast moving obstacles called asteroids. Collision with an asteroid causes the player to lose a life. Points are scored by shooting the asteroids and breaking them into two smaller, faster obstacles. Asteroids progress from large to medium to small. If a small asteroid is hit, it is removed from the game. As the game goes on more and more obstacles are spawned. The goal for the player then is to stay alive as long as possible to keep shooting asteroids.

This game is interesting for several reasons. For starters there is no final goal, but rather the planner seeks to stay alive for as long as possible. This differentiates this problem from more traditional motion planning problems. Additionally, in this game there are no static states. Conservation of momentum keeps the ship moving at a constant velocity if there is no player input. Combined with the dynamic nature of the obstacles, the game state can change rapidly requiring frequent replanning.

The planner utilizes several processes in order to maximize the potential future score. An array of safe trajectories is first calculated and from this list another process selects one of these trajectories based on the anticipated rewards and costs. Finally, a third process determines the game inputs corresponding to following this trajectory and places these inputs in an executor queue to be performed as the replanning occurs. Factors for selecting a trajectory include, but are not limited to, time required to achieve that trajectory, density of asteroids along the trajectory, distance to obstacles along the trajectory and the ability to destroy asteroids along the way. The Methods section will go into greater detail about the techniques and strategies employed.

\section{Related Work}

A significant amount of literature exists for the problem of navigation with mobile obstacles. This literature tends to fall into one of two categories - local methods or global methods, based on how obstacles influence robot behavior \cite{khansari2012dynamical}. Local methods include bug algorithms and the Vector Field Histogram, while global methods include artifical potential fields and visibility graphs. Local methods tend to run rapidly but may not find feasible paths, while global methods will find a valid solution if there is one but tend to be slow. Given that our environment can be frequently changing as asteroids collide or are struck by bullets and break apart, a local method would appear to be a better choice to allow for rapid replanning; however, including some ability to look ahead is critical in an environment with moving obstacles. 

The selected approach for navigation planning is based on the concept of velocity obstacles, which takes into account all future obstacle/robot future relative positions, assuming constant velocities \cite{fiorini1998motion}. The constant velocity assumption is acceptable for our problem as the plan will be rebuilt frequently, which will account for any asteroid-asteroid or asteroid-bullet interactions. While the exact approach used will be described in detail later, the concept is to convert the space and time domain into a purely spatial representation which can be easily searched for collisions. This results in a velocity space representation of the robot and obstacles, which is then used for planning. This approach, unlike some navigation methods, generalizes well to real-world applications of robots with limited sensors and domain knowledge, and has been used for autonomous surface vessel navigation in the crowded Singapore harbor \cite{bandyophadyay2010simple}.
